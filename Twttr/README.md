# Twttr

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `twttr.py` that removes all vowels from a user-provided string. The program mimics the original idea behind Twitter (formerly "twttr"), where vowels were omitted to save space. Both uppercase and lowercase vowels (A, E, I, O, U) are removed.
