# Nutrition Facts

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `nutrition.py` that provides the number of calories in one portion of a fruit, based on the U.S. FDAâ€™s poster for the 20 most frequently consumed raw fruits. The program prompts the user to input a fruit name (case-insensitively) and outputs the corresponding calories. Inputs that are not in the list of fruits are ignored.
