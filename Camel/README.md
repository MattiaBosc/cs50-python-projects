# camelCase

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `camel.py` that converts variable names from camel case to snake case. Camel case (mixed case) is commonly used in many programming languages where the first letter of the first word is lowercase and the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase (e.g., `firstName`). Python recommends snake case, where words are lowercase and separated by underscores (e.g., `first_name`).
