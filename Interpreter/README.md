# Math Interpreter

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `interpreter.py` that allows users to perform basic arithmetic without knowing Python. The program prompts the user for an arithmetic expression in the format `x y z`, where:

- `x` is an integer  
- `y` is an operator: `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/`  
- `z` is an integer  

The program outputs the result as a floating-point number formatted to one decimal place. Division by zero is not allowed.
