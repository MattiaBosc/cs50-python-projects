# Seasons of Love

This project implements a Python program that calculates how many minutes a person has lived since their birthdate and outputs the result in English words, like the song *Seasons of Love* from Rent.

## Description

The program `seasons.py`:

- Prompts the user to enter their date of birth in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
- Calculates the number of minutes since that date until today (assuming both dates are at midnight).
- Accounts for leap years automatically.
- Prints the total minutes as English words instead of numerals.
- Exits gracefully with an error if the input format is invalid.
