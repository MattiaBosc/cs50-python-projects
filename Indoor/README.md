# Indoor Voice

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `indoor.py` that converts any user input into lowercase. The idea is to demonstrate that writing in all caps is like yelling, and sometimes it's better to use your “indoor voice” (write in lowercase). Punctuation and whitespace remain unchanged.
