# Vanity Plates

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `plates.py` that validates vanity license plates based on Massachusetts rules. A plate is considered valid if it meets all the following requirements:

1. Starts with at least two letters.  
2. Contains 2 to 6 characters (letters or numbers).  
3. Numbers, if present, must come at the end. The first number cannot be '0'.  
4. No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks are allowed.  

The program prompts the user for a plate and outputs `Valid` if it meets all requirements or `Invalid` otherwise. The function `is_valid` checks the validity of the plate.
