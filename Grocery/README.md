# Grocery List

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `grocery.py` that allows a user to create a grocery list. The program prompts the user to input items one by one until they press Control-D. After input ends, the program outputs the list of items in uppercase, sorted alphabetically, and prefixed by the number of times each item was entered. Inputs are case-insensitive.
