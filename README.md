# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python

## Description
This repository contains my personal implementations of projects from Harvard’s [CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50s-introduction-programming-python). Each project demonstrates Python programming concepts, including control structures, algorithms, file I/O, APIs, object-oriented programming, and data processing.

`grocery.py` lets users build a grocery list, outputs sorted counts in uppercase.

### 15. Indoor Voice
`indoor.py` converts user input to lowercase while preserving whitespace and punctuation.

### 16. Math Interpreter
`interpreter.py` evaluates arithmetic expressions `x y z` and outputs the result as a float.

### 17. Cookie Jar
`jar.py` implements a `Jar` class for depositing and withdrawing cookies.

### 18. Lines of Code (LOC)
`lines.py` counts lines of code in a Python file, ignoring blanks and comments.

### 19. Meal Time
`meal.py` determines the meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner) based on a time input.

### 20. NUMB3RS
`numb3rs.py` validates IPv4 addresses.

### 21. Nutrition Facts
`nutrition.py` outputs calories for a fruit from user input.

### 22. Outdated
`outdated.py` converts U.S.-formatted dates to ISO 8601 format.

### 23. Pizza Py
`pizza.py` formats a CSV menu into an ASCII table using `tabulate`.

### 24. Vanity Plates
`plates.py` validates Massachusetts vanity plates.

### 25. Playback Speed
`playback.py` simulates slower speech by replacing spaces with `...`.

### 26. Little Professor
`professor.py` quizzes users on addition problems with up to three attempts per question.

### 27. CS50 P-Shirt
`shirt.py` overlays a CS50 T-shirt image on a user-provided photo.

### 28. CS50 Shirtificate
`shirtificate.py` generates a PDF certificate with a CS50 T-shirt image and the user’s name.

### 29. Working 9 to 5
`working.py` converts 12-hour U.S. times to 24-hour format.

### 30. Regular, um, Expressions
`um.py` counts standalone occurrences of `"um"` in text.

### 31. Response Validation
`response.py` validates email addresses using a Python library, not regex.

### 32. Scourgify
`scourgify.py` cleans and splits student names from a CSV file into first and last names.

### 33. Seasons of Love
`seasons.py` calculates the total minutes a person has lived and outputs it in English words.

### 34. Felipe’s Taqueria
`taqueria.py` simulates ordering from a restaurant menu and calculates the total.

`tip.py` calculates the tip for a meal, using helper functions to convert strings to floats.

### 36. Twttr
`twttr.py` removes vowels from a string.

### 37. Watch on YouTube
`watch.py` extracts and converts YouTube URLs from `<iframe>` elements to `youtu.be` links.

## Notes
- All projects are implemented in **Python 3.12**.  
- Dependencies for some projects are listed in `requirements.txt` inside each project folder.  
- Includes both code implementations and experiment notes where applicable.
