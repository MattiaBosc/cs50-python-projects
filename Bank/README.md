# Home Federal Savings Bank

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `bank.py` inspired by *Seinfeld* (Season 7, Episode 24). The program prompts the user for a greeting and outputs an amount of money based on the greeting:

- If the greeting starts with `"hello"` (case-insensitive), output `$0`.  
- If the greeting starts with `"h"` but not `"hello"`, output `$20`.  
- Otherwise, output `$100`.  

Leading whitespace in the userâ€™s input is ignored.
