# Deep Thought

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `deep.py` inspired by *The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to the Galaxy*. The program prompts the user for the answer to the Great Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. It outputs `Yes` if the user inputs `42` or any of the following case-insensitive variants: `forty-two` or `forty two`. Any other input outputs `No`.
