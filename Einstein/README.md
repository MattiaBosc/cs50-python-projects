# Einstein

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `einstein.py` that calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einsteinâ€™s famous formula \(E = mc^2\). The program prompts the user for mass in kilograms (as an integer) and outputs the equivalent energy in Joules (also as an integer). The speed of light is approximated as 300,000,000 meters per second.
