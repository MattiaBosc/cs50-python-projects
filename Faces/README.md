# Making Faces

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `faces.py` that converts simple text emoticons into emoji. The program implements a function `convert` which replaces `:)` with 🙂 (slightly smiling face) and `:(` with 🙁 (slightly frowning face), leaving all other text unchanged. The `main` function prompts the user for input, applies `convert`, and prints the result.
