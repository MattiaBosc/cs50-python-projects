# Coke Machine

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `coke.py` that simulates a Coca-Cola vending machine. Each bottle costs 50 cents, and the machine only accepts coins in the following denominations: 25, 10, and 5 cents. The program prompts the user to insert coins one at a time, showing the remaining amount due after each valid coin. Once at least 50 cents have been inserted, the program outputs the change owed.
