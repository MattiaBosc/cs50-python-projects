# Outdated

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `outdated.py` that converts dates from U.S. format (month-day-year) to ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). The program prompts the user to input a date in either numeric format (e.g., `9/8/1636`) or with the month spelled out (e.g., `September 8, 1636`). The program validates the input and reprompts the user if the date is invalid.
