# Meal Time

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `meal.py` that tells you what meal it is based on the time of day. The program prompts the user for a time (in 24-hour format `#:##` or `##:##`) and outputs:

- `breakfast time` for 7:00–8:00  
- `lunch time` for 12:00–13:00  
- `dinner time` for 18:00–19:00  

If the time is not within any meal range, the program outputs nothing. The program includes a function `convert` that converts a time string to a float representing the number of hours (e.g., `"7:30"` → `7.5`).
