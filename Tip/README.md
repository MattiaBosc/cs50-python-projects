# Tip Calculator

**Description:**  
This project is a Python program called `tip.py` that calculates the tip for a meal in a restaurant. The program prompts the user for the cost of the meal and the desired tip percentage, then calculates and displays the tip amount. It includes two helper functions:

- `dollars_to_float(d)`: Converts a string in the format `$##.##` to a float. Example: `$50.00` → `50.0`.
- `percent_to_float(p)`: Converts a string in the format `##%` to a float representing the percentage. Example: `15%` → `0.15`.
